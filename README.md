# OOPAssignment

Final Project for my Object Orientated Programming Module Semester 3 September - December 2019.Note: Requires the JavaFX jar to run.

This project models a Veterinary Diagnostic tool. The Veterinarian can add a new pet to the System. The Veterinarian can also select the type of animal they are examining (dog or cat only due to time constraints) and whether it is a skin condition or a breathing issue troubling the animal.

In the case of a skin condition, appropriate images are displayed showing the Veterinarian common skin issues.

In the case of a breathing condition, sample sound files of animals with various breathing issues can be played.

In either case, the Veterinarian selects the radio button he feels best matches the animal's condition, the severity and clicks the submit button. The program will then suggest the recommended course of action based on the selected options.

The project also incorporates persistance in that the Veterinarian can save and load pets and diagnoses.
