Final Project for my Object Orientated Programming Module Semester 3 September - December 2019.

This project models a Veterinary Diagnostic tool. The Veterinarian can select the type of animal they are examining (dog or cat only due to time constraints) and whether it is a skin condition or a breathing issue troubling the animal.

In the case of a skin condition, appropriate images are displayed showing the Veterinarian common skin issues.

In the case of a breathing condition, sample sound files of animals with various breathing issues can be played.

In either case, the Veterinarian selects the radio button he feels best matches the animal's condition and clicks the submit button.
